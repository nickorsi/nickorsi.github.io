## First attempt at a personal portfolio written only with HTML and CSS

(Paragraph describing project)
This is my first attempt at a personal portfolio. I wrote it using only HTML and CSS, so there is very little interactivity. The portfolio site has the following sections:
* Navbar: Links to external career related sites and links to the pages below. 
* Welcome Page: Includes a picture and basic title
* About Page: Information about my career thus far
* Projects Page: Has no info currently, plan to add into this section later
* Contacts Page: Information on how to reach me and where I'm located.
