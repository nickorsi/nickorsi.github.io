            <p class="tldr"><span>TL;DR:</span> I'm Nick Orsi, a Software Engineer with civil engineering
              experience working on technically demanding, fast paced, dynamic projects looking
              to make an impact on the world at large.</p>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nick Orsi! I'm a licensed Civil Engineer turned Software Engineer.
              For the past 8 years I worked for Kiewit, a nationally recognized private
              contractor building awesome construction projects. I managed critical operations
              that were technically demanding, fast paced, and susceptible to dynamic changes.
              Despite these challenges, my efforts consistently resulted in quality products
              completed safely, under budget, and on time. I am proud of the work I did for my
              employer, the clients, and for the communities the projects serve.</p>
            <p>I have since decided to become a Software Engineer for several reasons. One is
              to pursue my passion for tech, which developed early in high school as I was
              exposed to science, math, and technology courses. I soon found myself learning
              intro to physics, chemistry, and even used 3D  modeling software and 3D printers to
              build cool projects. Coupled with my interest in video games, I even explored going
              to college to become a video game developer, but decided to follow the footsteps of
              my Aunt and Grandfather to pursue a Civil Engineer degree.</p>
            <p>The main reason I made this career change is to become an active contributor to an
              industry not bound to a particular work sector or geographical location. I see
              software engineering as an exciting chance to use my skillset once used to improve
              a particular region of the world to instead make a positive impact on the world at
              large. I plan to couple my previous experience working on technically demanding,
              fast paced, dynamic projects with my new skillset as a software engineer to
              continue to deliver quality products done safely, under budget, and on time.</p>
